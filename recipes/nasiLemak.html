    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Coconut Rice</strong>. Rinse the rice with running tap water,
          repeating the process a few times until the water turns clear. Drain
          the water completely. Add 1 ½ cups of water to the washed rice,
          followed by the coconut milk and a pinch of salt. Add the pandan
          leaves into the rice and cook your rice. Discard the pandan leaves
          after rice is cooked.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Spicy Paste</strong>. Pound the shallots, garlic, dried
          chilies, and prawn paste with a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, you
          can grind them with a food processor.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Tamarind Water</strong>. Soak the tamarind pulp in water for
          15 minutes. Constantly squeeze the tamarind to extract its flavor into
          the water. Drain the pulp and save the tamarind juice.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fried Anchovies.</strong>. Rinse the dried anchovies with tap
          water a few times and let them drain. Heat 2 cups of oil in a pan, fry
          the anchovies until they've become light brown and crispy. Remove from
          oil with a strainer and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. You can
          serve them as is, or add them into sambal to make sambal anchovies.

          rings and fried anchovies, stirring well. Pour in the tamarind juice,
          salt, and sugar. Simmer on low heat until the sauce thickens. Set it

          fish, hard boiled egg, roasted peanuts, and cucumber around the rice.
